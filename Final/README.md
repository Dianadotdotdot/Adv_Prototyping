## Introduction   

The concept is an educational interactive board, presenting people "morie effect"
There are 3 pieces of transparent paper with patterns, together, they created this illusion. 
I was facinated by this illution so I decide to create a prototype around this topic.

## Implementation   

Here is the initial sketch:
![Sketch.jpeg
](https://github.com/Dianadotdotdot/Adv_Prototyping/blob/main/Final/Design.png)

The 2 180 servo will be connected to the 2 angle unit, controlling the rotating degree.
The 360 servo will be connected to adafruit through wifi, and the rotation speed can be adjusted on a phone slider.


### Hardware

* AtomS3 Development Kit 
* ATOMIC PortABC Extension Base   
* Mini Angle Unit *2
* Servo Kit 180° *2

### Firmware   

[https://github.com/Dianadotdotdot/Adv_Prototyping/blob/main/Final/Thonny%20Code]


To include code snippets, you can use the code block markdown, like this:

``` Python  
if(sensor_val > 100):  # sensor value higher than threshold
   led_pin.on()  # turn on LED
```

### Software   

Adafruit

### Integrations   

Include a link to and/or screenshots of any communication components used in your project, like Adafruit IO feeds, dashboards, IFTTT applets, etc.  

### Enclosure / Mechanical Design   

Explain how you made the enclosure or any other physical or mechanical aspects of your project with photos, screenshots of relevant files such as laser-cut patterns, 3D models, etc. (it’s great if you’re willing to share the editable source files too!)

## Project outcome  

Summarize the results of your final project implementation and include some photos of the prototype and a video walkthrough showing it working.  

Note that GitHub has a small size limit for uploading files via browswer (25Mb max), so you may choose to use a link to YouTube, Google Drive, or another external site.

## Conclusion  

As you wrap up the project, reflect on your experience of creating it.  Use this as an opportunity to mention any discoveries or challenges you came across along the way.  If there is anything you would have done differently, or have a chance to continue the project development given more time or resources, it’s a good way to conclude this section.

## Project references  

Please include links to any online resources like videos or tutorials that you may have found helpful in your process of implementing the prototype. If you used any substantial code from an online resource, make sure to credit the author(s) or sources.
