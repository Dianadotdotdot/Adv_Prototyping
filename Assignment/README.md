## Assignment 1

### Introduction
This assignment is called "Friendship Circle," and the concept is a sock with magnet hands.
If the hands connect together, the LED stripe placed in front will light up in white. 
After 5 seconds of connection, the LED stripe will flash light between pink, blue, and yellow.
If disconnected, the light will turn blue and pause, until it is reconnected.

### Hardware
* ATOM S3 
* BREADBRD
* DIGITAL RGB LED

### Firmware   

Upload your MicroPython code and highlight important code snippet(s) that make 
your prototype work.  Most likely you should explain the inputs/outputs used 
in your code and how they affect the behavior of the prototype.

To include code snippets, you can use the code block markdown:

``` Python  
  if input_pin.value():  # read digital input
    led_pin.off()        # turn off LED light
  else:
    led_pin.on()         # turn on LED light
```

### Physical Components   

Explain what products, materials or components you used for the project. 
If you fabricated your own project components, include some details on 
how you made them.

### Project outcome  

Summarize the results of your project implementation and include at least 
1 photo of the finished prototype.  

Finally, include a short video walkthrough of your project showing all of 
its functioning aspects (voice over is optional but could be helpful).  

Note that GitHub has a small size limit for uploading files via browswer (25Mb max), 
so you may choose to use a link to YouTube, Google Drive, or another external site.
